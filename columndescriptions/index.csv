There are nine essential amino acids: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. They are vital for numerous bodily functions, including protein synthesis, tissue repair, muscle growth, and the production of enzymes and neurotransmitters. Deficiency can lead to various health problems."
amiacce,Conditionally essential Amino acids,"AAs required during illness/stress (e.g., arginine).","Amino acids that are normally synthesized by the body (non-essential) but become essential under certain conditions, such as illness, injury, stress, or specific developmental stages (e.g., infancy, pregnancy). During these times, the body's demand for these amino acids exceeds its capacity to produce them, requiring dietary intake. Examples include arginine, glutamine, cysteine, glycine, proline, and tyrosine."
amiacne,Non-essential Amino acids,"AAs body can synthesize (e.g., alanine).","Amino acids that the human body can synthesize on its own, meaning they don't strictly need to be obtained from the diet. However, they are still crucial for overall health and bodily functions, including protein building and various metabolic processes. Examples include alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, and serine."
amiac,Amino acids,Building blocks of proteins; diverse metabolic roles.,"Organic compounds that serve as the fundamental building blocks of proteins. They are essential for numerous biological processes, including building and repairing tissues (like muscles), producing enzymes and hormones, supporting immune function, and nutrient transport. Amino acids contain both an amino group and a carboxyl group. Some are synthesized by the body (non-essential), while others must be obtained from the diet (essential)."
orgac,Organic acids,"Acidic compounds (e.g., citric acid); flavor/preservation roles.","A broad class of organic compounds with acidic properties, commonly found in foods, contributing to their flavor (e.g., citric acid in lemons, malic acid in apples, lactic acid in yogurt, acetic acid in vinegar).

Excessive intake of certain organic acids might cause digestive discomfort in sensitive individuals."
fauns,Unsaturated Fatty acids,Includes MUFAs/PUFAs; heart-healthy fats.,"Fats that are typically liquid at room temperature, found predominantly in plant-based foods (like vegetable oils, nuts, seeds) and fish. They are considered beneficial fats as they can help improve blood cholesterol levels, reduce inflammation, stabilize heart rhythms, and provide energy. They include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids."
faess,Essential Fatty acids,Omega-3/6; must be obtained from diet.,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids that the human body cannot synthesize and must be obtained from the diet. They are crucial for health, playing vital roles in cell membrane structure and function, brain development, vision, inflammation regulation, and as precursors to important signaling molecules. The primary essential fatty acids are linoleic acid (an omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3)."
facn3,Cis ω-3 Fatty acids,"Anti-inflammatory (ALA, EPA, DHA); critical for brain/heart.","A type of polyunsaturated essential fatty acid characterized by a double bond at the third carbon atom from the methyl end (omega end) and a 'cis' configuration of hydrogen atoms at the double bonds. Key omega-3s include ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) found in plant oils, and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) found in fatty fish and algae. They are crucial for brain function, vision, reducing inflammation, heart health (e.g., lowering triglycerides), and fetal development."
facn6,Cis ω-6 Fatty acids,Pro-inflammatory in excess (linoleic/arachidonic acid). Balance with ω-3.,"A family of polyunsaturated essential fatty acids with a final carbon-carbon double bond in the n-6 position (sixth bond from the methyl end) and 'cis' configuration. Linoleic acid is the primary omega-6. They are vital for brain function, normal growth and development, skin and hair growth, bone health, metabolism regulation, and reproductive system maintenance. While essential, a balanced ratio with omega-3s is important, as excessive omega-6 intake relative to omega-3s can promote inflammation."
facn9,Cis ω-9 Fatty acids,"Non-essential (body can produce); e.g., oleic acid.","A family of monounsaturated fatty acids characterized by a final carbon-carbon double bond in the n-9 position (ninth bond from the methyl end) and 'cis' configuration. Oleic acid (found in olive oil, avocados, nuts) is the most common. While the body can produce them, dietary intake is still beneficial. They can help reduce LDL ('bad') cholesterol, raise HDL ('good') cholesterol, and may have anti-inflammatory effects, contributing to cardiovascular health."
facn5,Cis ω-5 Fatty acids,Rare; minor roles in skin/cell membrane health.,"A group of less common polyunsaturated fatty acids with a double bond at the omega-5 position and typically a 'cis' configuration (though punicic acid is a conjugated linolenic acid isomer which has a mix of cis and trans bonds in its conjugated system). Punicic acid, found primarily in pomegranate seed oil, is the most well-known omega-5. It exhibits strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, and anti-cancer properties. It's studied for neuroprotective effects and benefits against various chronic diseases."
facn7,Cis ω-7 Fatty acids,Palmitoleic acid; metabolic health benefits.,"A class of monounsaturated fatty acids with the double bond at the seventh carbon from the omega end and 'cis' configuration. Palmitoleic acid is a common example. They are not essential as the body can synthesize them. Omega-7s are linked to improved skin health (moisture, elasticity), metabolic health (insulin sensitivity, fat metabolism), reduced inflammation, and better cardiovascular markers (lower LDL, higher HDL). Sources include sea buckthorn oil and macadamia nuts."
facis,Cis Fatty acids,Natural unsaturated fats; bend in structure (healthier than trans).,"Unsaturated fatty acids where the hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond are on the same side of the molecule. This 'cis' configuration results in a kink or bend in the fatty acid chain, which increases cell membrane fluidity. Most naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids (like omega-3s, omega-6s, and many omega-9s) are in the cis form. They are generally considered healthier than trans fatty acids."
fatrn,Trans Fatty acids,Industrial trans fats (partially hydrogenated oils) raise heart disease risk.,"Unsaturated fatty acids where hydrogen atoms are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond (trans configuration). Small amounts occur naturally in some animal products, but most are industrially produced via partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils. Artificial trans fats are detrimental to health, significantly increasing the risk of heart disease by raising LDL (bad) cholesterol and lowering HDL (good) cholesterol. They also contribute to inflammation, insulin resistance, and other health problems. Generally recognized as having no health benefits."
olsac,Oligosaccharides,"Prebiotics (e.g., raffinose); feed gut bacteria but may cause gas.","Carbohydrates composed of a small number (typically 3 to 10) of simple sugar (monosaccharide) units linked together. Many oligosaccharides are not digestible by human enzymes and thus function as prebiotics, selectively feeding beneficial bacteria in the colon. This promotes gut health, improves digestion, enhances nutrient absorption (like calcium), and can boost immune function. Common examples include fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)."
phystr,Phytosterols,Plant sterols; lower cholesterol by blocking absorption.,"Naturally occurring compounds found in plants (e.g., fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts) that have a chemical structure similar to cholesterol. They help lower blood cholesterol levels, particularly LDL ('bad') cholesterol, by competing with cholesterol for absorption in the digestive system. Consuming phytosterols as part of a healthy diet can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. They may also offer protection against obesity, diabetes, and certain cancers."
mnrleq,Essential Quantity Minerals,"Macrominerals (e.g., calcium, magnesium) needed in grams.","Minerals that the human body requires in relatively large amounts (typically more than 100 milligrams per day) for proper functioning and overall health. Also known as major minerals, they include calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, and sulfur. They are essential for various vital roles such as bone and teeth structure, muscle contraction, nerve function, fluid balance, energy metabolism, and as components of enzymes and hormones."
mnrlet,Essential Trace Minerals,"Microminerals (e.g., iron, zinc) needed in milligrams.","Essential minerals that the human body requires in very small amounts (typically less than 100 milligrams per day, often in microgram quantities) for various physiological functions. Also known as microminerals, they include iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, iodine, chromium, molybdenum, and fluoride. They often act as cofactors for enzymes, are involved in hormone function, oxygen transport, immune response, and antioxidant defense, playing critical roles in growth, development, and overall health."
mnrlpet,Possibly essential Trace Minerals,"e.g., boron; roles under investigation.","Trace minerals for which evidence suggests they may play a role in human health and nutrition, but their essentiality has not been definitively established or the exact requirements are unclear. Research is ongoing for elements like boron, silicon, nickel, and vanadium. They might be involved in processes like bone health, enzyme function, or metabolism, but more studies are needed to confirm their status as essential nutrients for humans."
mnrlnet,Non-essential Trace Minerals,"e.g., lithium; no known biological role.","Trace minerals that are found in the human body, often due to environmental exposure or diet, but for which no specific biological function or dietary requirement has been established. Their absence from the diet does not lead to deficiency symptoms. Some non-essential trace minerals can accumulate and become toxic at higher concentrations, while others may be largely inert. Examples might include elements like aluminum (in certain contexts, though it's also listed as toxic), tin, or barium, depending on the specific definitions and concentrations considered."
mnrltx,Toxic Minerals,"Arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury; harmful even in traces.","Minerals that can cause adverse health effects or toxicity in humans, even at relatively low levels of exposure. They have no known beneficial role in human nutrition and can interfere with normal physiological processes, damage organs, or increase the risk of diseases like cancer and neurological disorders. Common examples include lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and aluminum (Al in high amounts). Exposure is typically through contaminated food, water, or environment."
carot,Carotenes,"Provitamin A pigments (e.g., β-carotene); antioxidants.","A class of organic pigments found in plants, algae, and some fungi, responsible for yellow, orange, and red colors. They are a type of carotenoid. Important carotenes include alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and gamma-carotene. Some carotenes (like beta-carotene) are provitamin A, meaning the body can convert them into vitamin A. Carotenes also function as antioxidants, protecting cells from damage by free radicals."
xantp,Xanthophylls,"Oxygenated carotenoids (e.g., lutein); eye protection.","A class of yellow pigments and a type of carotenoid that contain oxygen atoms, distinguishing them from carotenes (which are hydrocarbons). They are found in the leaves of most green plants, algae, and certain bacteria. Xanthophylls, such as lutein and zeaxanthin, function as accessory light-harvesting pigments in photosynthesis and protect against photo-oxidative damage. In humans, they act as antioxidants and are particularly important for eye health (concentrated in the macula)."
cartbeq,β-Carotene equivalents,Measure of vitamin A activity from carotenoids.,"A measure used to express the total vitamin A activity of various provitamin A carotenoids in food, relative to the activity of beta-carotene. Since different carotenoids (like alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin) convert to vitamin A at different efficiencies compared to beta-carotene, equivalents are used to standardize their contribution to vitamin A intake. This helps in assessing the overall vitamin A value of a diet containing multiple carotenoid sources. Often, this concept is now incorporated into Retinol Activity Equivalents (RAE)."
vita,Vitamin A,Retinol/carotenoids; vision/immune function.,"A fat-soluble vitamin essential for vision (especially in low light), immune function, reproduction, cell growth, and the maintenance of healthy skin, teeth, skeletal tissue, and mucous membranes. It exists in two main forms: preformed vitamin A (retinol and retinyl esters, found in animal products) and provitamin A carotenoids (like beta-carotene, found in plant foods), which the body converts to vitamin A."
vit,Vitamins,Organic compounds essential for metabolism/health.,"A group of organic compounds that are essential in small quantities for normal cell function, growth, development, and overall health. The body cannot synthesize most vitamins in sufficient amounts, so they must be obtained through the diet. There are 13 essential vitamins, broadly classified as fat-soluble (A, D, E, K) and water-soluble (B-complex vitamins and C). Each vitamin has specific functions, and deficiencies can lead to various health problems."
